# Data integrity

- `parseManifest` validates the chunk *layout*, not just the total size — a correct sum
  with individually wrong chunk sizes yields a file with a hole while every per-chunk
  sha256 still matches.
- `runUpload` re-stats the source after the last chunk and refuses to send the manifest
  if size or mtime moved: a file rewritten mid-upload gives a self-consistent manifest
  for a hybrid that never existed.
- `runRestore` writes `<target>.partial`, verifies every chunk's size and sha256 plus the
  final length, and renames only after all of it passes.
- Manifests and state files are both untrusted input (one from a chat, one from disk a
  truncated write or hand edit can mangle). `parseManifest` and `planChunks` reject
  anything that is not a whole number of bytes rather than doing arithmetic on it: a
  string or null does not throw, it rejects for the wrong reason or spins a loop that
  never advances until memory runs out.
- `~/.telstore/config.json` is hand-editable, so it gets the same treatment: a stored
  value is parsed through the same function as the flag, and a `settings` that is not an
  object is named rather than stepped over — otherwise telstore runs on defaults while
  the user's own choices sit there ignored.
- A `note` is absent from the manifest rather than null when nobody wrote one, so a manifest
  without one is the same file telstore wrote before the flag existed and `MANIFEST_VERSION`
  stays 1 — bumping it would make an older telstore refuse a backup it can restore perfectly.
  `parseManifest` still refuses a `note` that is not text: nothing restores differently because
  of it, but a manifest is a file a person can edit and send back, and a field holding
  something other than what it claims to be is where telstore stops rather than guesses.
- The local record is the only pointer to chunks in the chat, so `runUpload` refuses a
  `--chunk-size` that differs from the unfinished backup's own rather than starting over,
  and `pruneStates` (keeps `MAX_STATES` most recent) names on stderr every id it drops,
  even when the caller asked for silence.
